Observability for GenAI systems includes metrics, logs, traces, and audit trails.
For RAG systems, observability tracks retrieval results, chunk IDs, scores, prompt versions, model versions, latency, and errors.
A strong audit trail helps debug hallucinations by linking each answer to the retrieved chunks and the configuration used in that run.
